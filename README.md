# Calculator
A functional calculator with Order of Operations.

##Features
###BASIC OPERATIONS
- Addition - 1 + 2 = 3
- Multiplication - 1 * 2 = 2
- Division - 1 / 2 = 0.5
- Subtraction - 1 - 2 = -1
 
###COMPREHENSIVE OPERATIONS
- Successive operations - 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
- Decimals - 1 . 1 + 1 . 1 = 2.2
- Multiple decimals - 1 ... 1 + 1 ... 1 = 2.2
- Multiple operations - 1 ++++ 2 = 3
- Changing operations - 1 + - * 2 = 2
- Operation repeat - 1 + 1 = = = 4
- Operation rollover - 1 + 1 + = + = -> 8
- Division by zero - 1 / 0	= "Error"

###ADVANCED OPERATIONS
- Premature operation - ++++ 1 * 3 = 3
- Missing operation - 3 = 3
- Partial operand - 3 * = 9
- Order of operations - 1 + 3 / 4 + 10 * 2	= -> 21.75
- Plus/minus - 4 ± + 4 ± = -> -8 
- Binary rounding - 0.1 + 0.2 -> 0.3 (not 0.300000004)
